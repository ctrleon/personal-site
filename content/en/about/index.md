Welcome to my website! Here, I like to gather and share thoughts on anything I find worth discussing or remembering.

## About Me

My name is Cristina Leon.
I'm studying **Computer Science** (B.Sc.) at the [University of Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de) with a focus on IT security and a minor in Physics.

## Interests

My main interests revolve around Linux, server administration, and free and open-source software.  

When I’m not studying, I enjoy tinkering with my Debian 12 home server and Raspberry Pi 4B, as well as working on personal coding projects to share with others.

Away from the keyboard, you’ll usually find me swimming or listening to Latin American music.
