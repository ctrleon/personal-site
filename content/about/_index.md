Welcome to my site!
Here I collect various thoughts on whatever I deem worth sharing or preserving.

## About me
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in **Computer Science** at [University of Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de), with a focus on IT security, alongside a minor in Physics.

In my spare time I like to tinker with my **home server** and build **personal projects** to share.
I also enjoy swimming, paddleboarding and Latin music.
